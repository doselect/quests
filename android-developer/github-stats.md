# GitHub Stats App

GitHub is a great platform for developers who read and write open-source code. A lot of developers wear their open-source contribution as a badge of honor, which is a great thing. Your job is to create an app that helps developers bask in their glory with ease.

## Description

Create an Android application that developers can use to keep track of their contributions on GitHub regularly. The app should allow the user to connect their GitHub account, and should show the following metrics on the dashboard:

- Total repositories
- Total stars received
- Total lines of code written
- List of all languages used by the developer

The dashboard should also have a button to refresh these stats. The app should NOT use any server backend, and everything should be stored locally on the device.

## Styling

Use Google's Material Design spec. Design of the app carries equal weightage as the correctness of the funcionality. There are no design restrictions, so you are free to use your creativity.

## Submission details

Send the packaged APK and the link of the source for submission. The APK should be installable on Android Nougat.
