# Data Dashboard

Companies today rely on data to take almost all their decisions. In DoSelect's
case, the teams who use the platform for managing their hiring workflows
have a lot of data points at their disposal.

In case of campus hiring, the following data points are captured about the
candidates:
 - College name
 - Stream of engineering
 - Average CGPA
 - Test scores
 - List of technologies the candidate is proficient in

Your task is to come up with a data-driven dashboard that helps a campus
hiring manager in a company make these decisions:
 - Which colleges should be considered, profile wise, to hire freshers in the
 next hiring season?
 - Which colleges should be dropped?
 - What kind of candidates have performed the best in tests? Which streams should
 be dropped in the next hiring season?

## Description

You need to create mocks of a data-dashboard, preferably with inteactions, which
would help a recruiter easily answer these questions. The mockups should be
accompanied with user stories and workflow description. Please document the reason
of any major design that you need to take as part of building this.

If you think some more data points would enrich this dashboard, please mention
them and use them in the mockups.

## Submission

Please send a zip archive of all the solution material to your PoC.
