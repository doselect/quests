# Quests

Quests are programming challenges you must solve to get a tête-à-tête with
DoSelect engineering team when you've already cleared the online coding round.
Generally, a quest should take you no more than a week to finish. Please read
along for further details. 


## Submission details

Once you are done with building your app, please do the following things:

- [ ] Publish it in a public GitHub repo
- [ ] If the app has a live preview, host it on a free provider, like Heroku / GH Pages / whatever applicable. This is not mandatory, but a big plus.
- [ ] Send an email to your point-of-contact with these details, or just email at [42@doselect.com](mailto:42@doselect.com)

We tend to be pretty fast at these things, so expect to hear back from us within a
couple of days of submission with next steps.


## Clarifications

If you have any suggestions / queries in the existing quest descriptions, please
create an issue in this repo, or shout out to us [@DoSelectHQ](https://twitter.com/DoSelectHQ).


## Contributing

If you think you have a cool idea you want to
contribute, please send a PR and we would love to send you a cool t-shirt
if the PR's merged. :metal:
